# Sign-up-Form
I designed and developed a responsive sign-up form using HTML and CSS, implementing best practices in UI/UX design and form accessibility. 
The project features dynamic styling with pseudo-classes for interactive input validation, a visually appealing layout with an external font and background image, and a polished user experience. 
This experience reinforced my development skills, particularly in structuring layouts, styling forms, and enhancing usability.
